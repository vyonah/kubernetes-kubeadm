# Vagrant Kubernetes Cluster Setup
# Overview
This Vagrant script provisions a local Kubernetes cluster environment using VirtualBox, creating one master node and two worker nodes on an Ubuntu Bionic (18.04) base image. The setup enables you to experiment with Kubernetes in a controlled local environment, ideal for testing and learning purposes.

# Purpose
The script automates the provisioning and configuration of virtual machines (VMs) that mimic a Kubernetes cluster. It defines:

One master node: Responsible for managing the cluster, maintaining the API server, and scheduling workloads.
Two worker nodes: Nodes where the applications (pods) will run.
Configuration
Network
The virtual machines are connected on a private network with IPs in the range 192.168.56.X. The master node IP starts at 192.168.56.1, while worker nodes increment from 192.168.56.2.

Memory and CPU
Each node is configured with:

Memory: 2 GB
CPUs: 2 cores
Port Forwarding
SSH access to each VM is provided by forwarding ports on the host machine:

Master Node: Port 2711 maps to guest port 22.
Worker Nodes: Ports 2721 and 2722 map to guest port 22.
Provisioning Scripts
The VMs are configured with two shell scripts:

setup-hosts.sh: Updates /etc/hosts in each VM with the IPs and hostnames of all cluster nodes.
update-dns.sh: Configures DNS settings specific to this environment.
Usage
Clone this repository and navigate to the directory.
Run vagrant up to start and provision the VMs.
SSH into the master or worker nodes using vagrant ssh <node_name>.
Important Notes
Node Scaling: To change the number of master or worker nodes, adjust the NUM_MASTER_NODE and NUM_WORKER_NODE values in the script and update the setup-hosts.sh script accordingly.
Network Interface: Ensure the network interface enp0s8 is compatible with your host system.
This script is an excellent starting point for experimenting with Kubernetes on a local machine, enabling you to test various cluster configurations and setups.
