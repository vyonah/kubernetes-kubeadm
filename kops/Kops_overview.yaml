What is kops?
https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/getting_started/aws/
kops (short for Kubernetes Operations) is a command-line tool for managing production-grade Kubernetes clusters in the cloud, primarily on AWS, though it also supports GCP, OpenStack, and other platforms. It allows users to create, configure, update, and delete Kubernetes clusters and the associated cloud resources in a way that emphasizes infrastructure as code.

Key Features
Automated Cluster Provisioning: kops automates the setup of Kubernetes clusters, including cloud infrastructure such as EC2 instances, load balancers, networking, storage, and DNS.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Cluster definitions can be managed as code in YAML or JSON files, enabling versioning, reproducibility, and easy collaboration.
Highly Available Clusters: Supports the creation of highly available clusters with redundant control planes across multiple zones for fault tolerance.
Rolling Updates and Scaling: Simplifies rolling updates for Kubernetes versions and instance scaling, minimizing downtime during maintenance or scaling operations.
Cloud-Native Integrations: Seamlessly integrates with cloud provider-specific resources, such as AWS Route 53 for DNS management and S3 for state storage, allowing easy cluster state management and recovery.
Use Cases
Production Cluster Deployment: kops is widely used to deploy highly available, production-ready Kubernetes clusters on AWS. With features like multi-zone deployment and cluster versioning, it’s well-suited for mission-critical applications.
DevOps and CI/CD Environments: Enables DevOps teams to set up, update, and tear down clusters for continuous integration and delivery pipelines, ensuring a consistent and repeatable infrastructure.
Self-Managed Kubernetes: For organizations that prefer to manage their own Kubernetes clusters rather than use fully managed services (e.g., Amazon EKS), kops provides a flexible solution with greater control over Kubernetes versions and configurations.
Testing and Development Clusters: Easily deploy disposable, short-lived clusters for development and testing. Clusters can be created quickly and destroyed afterward, ideal for testing new Kubernetes versions or applications.
Disaster Recovery: With kops and an S3 state store, organizations can back up their cluster configurations and infrastructure states, facilitating recovery in case of failure or disaster.
How kops Works
State Storage: kops uses a state store (e.g., S3 bucket) to save cluster configurations, making it easy to manage, update, and recover clusters.
Cluster Creation: Users define their cluster specifications using kops create cluster with desired options for control plane, node size, zones, and Kubernetes version.
Update and Validation: The kops update cluster command applies changes, such as scaling or version upgrades. The kops validate cluster command verifies the cluster’s health.
Cluster Deletion: kops delete cluster command removes all associated resources, ensuring a clean teardown.
Sample Workflow
Initialize: Define the cluster settings and environment variables.
Provision State Store: Set up an S3 bucket with versioning and encryption for state storage.
Create Cluster: Run kops create cluster with the desired settings for control plane size, node count, and availability zones.
Apply Configuration: Use kops update cluster --yes to provision the cluster.
Validation: Confirm cluster health and status with kops validate cluster.
Maintenance: For updates or scaling, use kops rolling-update cluster to apply changes with minimal downtime.
Deletion: Remove the cluster and clean up resources with kops delete cluster.

Important kops Commands:
Create a Cluster:
Initializes a Kubernetes cluster with defined specifications such as zones, instance sizes, and Kubernetes version.
Command: kops create cluster --name <cluster_name> --zones <zones> --node-size <node_size> --control-plane-size <control_plane_size> --kubernetes-version <version>

Update a Cluster:
Applies any changes made to the cluster configuration, such as scaling or updating Kubernetes versions.
Command: kops update cluster --name <cluster_name> --yes

Validate a Cluster:
Verifies the cluster’s health and ensures all nodes are operational.
Command: kops validate cluster --wait <time>

Rolling Update for Minimal Downtime:
Applies updates (e.g., version upgrades, instance replacements) to cluster nodes with minimal downtime.
Command: kops rolling-update cluster --name <cluster_name> --yes

Edit Cluster Configuration:
Allows modification of the cluster configuration stored in the state store, such as scaling configurations or network settings.
Command: kops edit cluster --name <cluster_name>

Delete a Cluster:
Cleans up all resources related to the Kubernetes cluster, including VMs, networking, and state configurations.
Command: kops delete cluster --name <cluster_name> --yes

Export Cluster Configuration to YAML
Exports the cluster definition to YAML, which can then be stored in version control.
Command: kops get cluster --name <cluster_name> -o yaml

Manage S3 State Store

kops uses an S3 bucket to store the cluster state. It can be versioned and encrypted to provide a recoverable state history.
Command for creating S3 state store:

aws s3 mb s3://<bucket_name> --region <region>


kops export kubecfg --name ${NAME} --admin
